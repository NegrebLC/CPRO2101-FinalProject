Commands to run for initialization of project:
    npm init -y
    npm i express dotenv mongoose colors
    npm i -D nodemon
    npm i cors
    npm i bcryptjs jsonwebtoken

*If you use any other commands add them to the above list*
*Commit changes to these files to dev branch*

Create .env file (it is ignored by .gitignore):
DBCONNECTION = mongodb+srv://coolcats:NJibwijm8n6BDy6s@cool-cat-games.ryd0b60.mongodb.net/creature-db
We can change DBCONNECTION at some point but this should be fine for now
